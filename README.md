Hi everyone, i'm dimitrix, i think i'm medium level programmer. I started learned this world on my 12 years old but i left it in 14, at 16 years old i continued to now, currently  i'm 19 years old.
Started with c++ a few months and then i traveled to python, in that language i learned a lot of things. Right now, i'm go on with Solidity/Blockchain dev, to create Smart Contracts.
