Hi everyone, i'm dimitrix, better knew like Octavio. I'm jr programmer, i started learned this world on my 12 years old but i left it to 16 years old and continued to now,
started with c++ a few months and then i traveled to python, in that language i learned a lot of things. Right now, i'm go on with react native, to create mobile-apps.
I think mobile-phone is the future, so, let's go to aproach to this and take advantage.

I wanted create this app 'cause right now im on university, and when i have exams, take picture and upload to univerisity server it take me a lot of lost time like 10 minutes or 15,
and if i have something which let me take picture and instantly upload to a close pc and upload to fast to university forum, it would be the best thing in the word.

So, go on and help me with it!
